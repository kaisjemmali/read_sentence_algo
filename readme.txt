Read me

At this checkpoint, you are asked to write an algorithm 
that read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine :

- The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
- The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
- The number of vowels in the sentence.

Steps : 

(1) Declare variables.
(2) Ask the user for a sentence
(3) Do a for loop and two if statements
(4) We read every charachter to know the spaces
(5) The number of words is the number of spaces+1
(6) We read every charachter to know the voyels
(7) We add +1 to voyels counter if we finf a voyels
(8) The number of caracters is the length of phrase if we consider space and point like caracter.
